# My First NET Solution
A NET Solution is a collection of multiple related projects, along with any build information, and other files.

Considering that this is my first time utilizing it, this will contain projects regarding tutorials of certain programming languages and tools, such as C#, C++, ASP.NET, etc.

## My first C# Program
Under project `CSharpTutorial`, I learned C#, a general-purpose high-level language that supports OOP for software component development.
It is considered to be robust, durable, and productive for the programmer.
C# also can be used for various systems, large or small, hosted or embeddded.

In this program, I went through a 4-hour 19-part course from `freeCodeCamp.org` with the following parts:
1. Hello World + Draw A Shape
2. Variables
3. Data Types + Strings + Numbers
4. User Input
5. Basic Calculator (Mini Project 1)
6. Mad Libs Game (Mini Project 2)
7. Arrays
8. Methods
9. Return Statement
10. If Statement
11. Better Calculator (Mini Project 3)
12. Switch Statement
13. While Loops
14. Guessing Game (Mini Project 4)
15. For Loops
16. Exponent Function (Mini Project 5)
17. 2D Arrays
18. Exception Handling
19. Classes + Objects
